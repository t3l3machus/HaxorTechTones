## Notes:
- nRF24L01 operates only in 2.4 GHz ISM band.
- CC1101 supports a wide range of Sub-GHz bands (300â€“928 MHz depending on configuration).
- BLE is a subset of Bluetooth, using 2.4 GHz with low power protocols.
- RFID is frequency-dependent â€” LF (~125 kHz), HF (13.56 MHz), and UHF (850â€“960 MHz) all exist, and require different readers.
- Wi-Fi modules (e.g., ESP8266/ESP32) cover 2.4 GHz, while others support both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.

## Key Terms:
- ISM: Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band â€” unlicensed, but regulated (power limits, duty cycles).
- FPV: First-person view â€” used in drones for live video feed.
- DECT: Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications â€” cordless phone tech.
- LoRa: Long Range low-power wireless communication.
- Zigbee: Mesh network protocol used for home automation.
